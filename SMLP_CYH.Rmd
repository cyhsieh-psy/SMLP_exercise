# Data Description

The data were mostly derived from Chinese Lexicon Project of lexical decision (Tse et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0810-5) and naming (Tse et al., 2022, https://osf.io/vwnps) performance on traditional two-character compound words. In this analysis, we focused on data of the lexical decision task, where participants were asked to judge if the compound word presented was a real word or a nonword. Using this dataset, we try to replicate key findings of Tse et al. (2017, 2022) by comparing the difference between lexical decision and naming latencies.

# Analysis/modelling issues:
1. For model comparison analysis, are there any other approaches better than comparing the AIC/BIC across different models? 

2. How to choose the appropriate model for accuracy data? Shall we input number of correct and incorrect trials for binomial models? Or is it possible to input the percentage of accuracy (0%-100%) as a continuous variable? How to deal with overdispersion?

3. What is the best effect size(s) reported for (G)LMM?

4. It takes long time to estimate the model for accuracy data. Are there ways to optimise and speed up the process?
