In this repo, the data were mostly derived from Chinese Lexicon Project of lexical decision (Tse et al., 2017) and naming (Tse et al., 2022) performance on traditional two-character compound words. Combining the two datasets, we try to replicate key findings of Tse et al. (2017, 2022) by comparing the difference between lexical decision and naming latencies.
